<h3>See something different</h3>
<p>
This year <?=$approvedCount?> people saw something and said something <em>different</em>.
</p>
<p>
September 11th showed us we're vulnerable.We are not immune to terrorism; we are part of the battleground. But its horror also showed us our strength. That a city scared to death can be courageous. We all can be heroes. To keep us safe, the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority told us to look for signs of danger, and report them. We think we should also look for signs of courage. We call them hero reports.
