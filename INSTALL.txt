# Instructions for installing the Heroreports Website #


## Infrastructure ##


### Requirements ###

The Heroreports codebase is written as a database driven web application in the 
[CakePHP v1.3](http://cakephp.org/) framework.  As such, it relies on a server that runs:
* HTTP Server (preferably Apache with mod_rewrite)
* PHP v4.3.2 or greater
* a database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS Sql Server, Oracle, SqlLite)
* SVN (to check out the code)
Tip: An easy way to set up a development computer is to install the 
[XAMPP program](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).

## Installation ##

The code is stored in an [SVN repository on codebasehq]
(https://c4fcm.codebasehq.com/heroreports/heroreports-cake/tree/head). This
document will assume you're installing on linux, with Apache2 and MySQL.  
We'll also assume you're installing to `/var/prod-www/mycity/`.  On windows 
you could use C:\heroreports\.

### Set Up a Apache and MySql ###

1. Add a virtual host for your site by editing the httpd.conf file on your computer,
adding an entry to the end:
    VirtualHost *:88
        ServerName mycity.heroreports.org
        DocumentRoot /var/prod-www/mycity/
    /VirtualHost
2. Restart Apache to load this new setting.  On linux do this:
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
3. Create a `heroreports_mycity` database on your favorite tool (we use 
PhpMyAdmin). For the production server [here is a link]
(http://www.heroreports.org/phpmyadmin/).  Make it utf_unicode so we
can handle any language well.
4. Create an db account called `hr_mycity`, and a password, and add
all permissions for this user on the `heroreports_mycity` database.

### Set Up a Subdomain for a Production Server ###

First figure out what you want your URL to be (someplace.heroreports.org).  
Then log into Linode and set up a AAA name record for that subdomain.  
Do this even if you're hosting on some other server so that we have all 
the network members linked to in a consistent way.

### Get and Run the Code ###

1. Go into `/var/prod-www/mycity/` and then checkout the code by running:
    svn checkout https://c4fcm.svn.codebasehq.com/heroreports/heroreports-cake/trunk mycity
2. Create a new `app/config/database.php` file (based on `app/config/database.php.template`).
Set the login, password, and database properties of the `default` connection
to those for the database you just created above.
3. Create a new `app/config/heroreports.php` file (based on  `app/config/heroreports.php.template`).
Open it up and edit the `Gui.CityName` and `Server.URL` properties.  Also change
the `Config.language` variable from 'eng' to 'spa' if you want the site in spanish.
4. Make all of the cache directories writable for the web user (or anyone 
if you don't care about security):
    chmod -R 777 app/tmp/cache/
    chmod -R 777 app/webroot/img/uploaded/
5. Create the empty database by running all the migrations:
    ./cake/console/cake migrate 

You now should be able to hit your url and see an empty generic 
Heroreports website!

### Configure Your Installation ###

The code you just installed is set up centered on the MIT area in Cambridge, MA, USA.  If you are 
starting a new site from scratch, you can change that in a Javascript configuration file.

1. Go into the theming directory:
    cd app/views/themed/
2. Make a new theme directory for your site, and copy the default
javascritp config file:
    mkdir mycity
    mkdir mycity/webroot
    mkdir mycity/webroot/js
    cp generic/webroot/js/heroreports-config.js mycity/webroot/js/
3. Open the `mycity/webroot/js/heroreports-config.js` and change the 
call to `HR.Map.SetDefaultLonLat` to the longitude and latitude of your
city.
4. Tell the app to use your theme by opening the `app/config/heroreports.php`
file and changing the `Gui.ThemeName` property to `mycity`.
5. Create an admin account for yourself by visiting `http://mycity.mysite.org/signup`.
Then log back into the database admin console (ie. PhpMyAdmin) and change the 
`hr_users.admin` flag for your entry. Now this account will be able to add users, etc.
6. Once you have created your account, you probably want to open up the 
`app/config/heroreports.php` file and change the `User.AllowSelfSignup` variable
to false.
7. Once you have it all set, open the `app/config/core.php` file and change 
the `debug` value to 0 to run the site in production mode.  Also open the
`app/config/heroreports.php` file and set the `Gui.IsDevInstall` variable to false.
